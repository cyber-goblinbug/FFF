            <h3>Recovered Records</h3>
            <h5> Day 1 — Initial Intake</h5>
            <p>Subjects arrived at 08:40 local time from state custodial transfer. All subjects are confirmed orphans with no immediate or extended family claims. Documentation verified. No follow-up inquiries anticipated.

Ages ranged from early childhood to pre-adolescence. All appeared physically healthy, with no outward abnormalities beyond previously documented genetic markers. Emotional response to intake was within expected parameters: confusion, mild distress, curiosity.

Baseline measurements were recorded successfully. Early indicators suggest strong compatibility with the planned modifications. Subjects demonstrated above-average recovery from minor stressors and showed no resistance to procedures beyond normal fear responses for their age group.

Notably, separation anxiety was minimal. Several subjects displayed unusual calm once intake was completed. One subject asked whether they were “supposed to be here,” then did not repeat the question after clarification was withheld.

No adverse reactions observed during the first phase. No fatalities. No deviations.

<b>Proceeding as scheduled</b>.
