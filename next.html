    <h2>Final notes</h2>
    <p>Test 269 attempted to build something beyond human limitation. We pursued height, strength, perception, endurance — and in doing so forced the subjects toward a state their minds could not sustain. They perceived too much, lived too long inside expanding awareness, and deteriorated accordingly.

We made the mistake of believing transcendence was the direction of progress.

The next phase must move differently.

The Davy Jones Locker experiment will explore death directly rather than attempting to engineer around it. Instead of pushing subjects upward toward hypothetical perfection, we will place them at the threshold where life and death meet repeatedly and observe what persists between those states.

Death has always been treated as a boundary condition — an endpoint. I believe it is instead a process. A transitional environment. If this is true, then repeated passage through that state may reveal continuity previously unmeasurable.

Test 269 demonstrated that the human mind fractures when forced to expand beyond its natural limits. This new project will determine whether the mind stabilizes when forced to confront its natural end repeatedly. Where 269 explored excess, Davy Jones Locker will explore subtraction: oxygen, time, certainty, and finally life itself.

Subjects will not be enhanced beyond recognition. They will instead be cycled through controlled death-state thresholds and returned, allowing observation of what changes — and what does not — with each passage. Memory retention, perception of continuity, emotional response, and identity cohesion will be primary measures.

If death is a barrier, repetition will confirm it. If death is permeable, repetition will reveal what crosses with the subject each time.

I believe this approach will yield clearer, more stable data than the uncontrolled cognitive expansion observed in Test 269. We will no longer attempt to create something above human. We will determine what remains when human life is repeatedly brought to its lowest possible state and restored.

Understanding death is not regression. It is the final variable left unmeasured.

This is progress. <br>
