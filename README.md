# The Nephilim Experiment
The facility had been abandoned for years. When explorers found it, the lights were dead, the halls silent. Among the dust and decay, a single server remained, powered by a backup generator no one could explain. On it were files labeled only “Continuation.”

The project had begun decades earlier, a genetic study with the stated goal of enhancing human adaptability. Internally, it was called something else: Reintegration Candidates.

The first subjects were children. Small, curious, unremarkable. They were chosen for rare traits: unusual bone growth, fast muscle recovery, reflexes that outpaced any adult, subtle cognitive anomalies. Over the years, the traits began to manifest—but slowly, almost imperceptibly, the children began to die.

One child grew taller than normal, limbs stretching unnaturally long. Bones densified, muscles strengthened without fatigue. They reacted before thinking. They slept less than anyone else, but never seemed tired. Their eyes perceived subtle movements and light patterns that no one else could detect. Their hair thickened rapidly, teeth became unnaturally strong, and faces shifted imperceptibly, like clay being molded without consent.

At first, the children remained calm, unnervingly so. They were faster, stronger, taller—but something about them felt wrong.

Years passed. The children grew into adults. Innocence vanished, replaced by minds slowly unraveling. Their bodies, once marvels of adaptation, began to fail. Wounds healed strangely, organs faltered intermittently, unexplained fevers appeared. The very traits meant to make them perfect were killing them from the inside.
