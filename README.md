# The Nephilim Experiment
The facility had been abandoned for years. When explorers found it, the lights were dead, the halls silent. Among the dust and decay, a single server remained, powered by a backup generator no one could explain. On it were files labeled only “Continuation.”

The project had begun decades earlier, a genetic study with the stated goal of enhancing human adaptability. Internally, it was called something else: Reintegration Candidates.

The first subjects were children. Small, curious, unremarkable. They were chosen for rare traits: unusual bone growth, fast muscle recovery, reflexes that outpaced any adult, subtle cognitive anomalies. Over the years, the traits began to manifest—but slowly, almost imperceptibly, the children began to die.

One child grew taller than normal, limbs stretching unnaturally long. Bones densified, muscles strengthened without fatigue. They reacted before thinking. They slept less than anyone else, but never seemed tired. Their eyes perceived subtle movements and light patterns that no one else could detect. Their hair thickened rapidly, teeth became unnaturally strong, and faces shifted imperceptibly, like clay being molded without consent.

At first, the children remained calm, unnervingly so. They were faster, stronger, taller—but something about them felt wrong.

Years passed. The children grew into adults. Innocence vanished, replaced by minds slowly unraveling. Their bodies, once marvels of adaptation, began to fail. Wounds healed strangely, organs faltered intermittently, unexplained fevers appeared. The very traits meant to make them perfect were killing them from the inside.

As the years dragged on, the madness became impossible to ignore. The subjects muttered constantly, describing things no one else could see. Walls appeared to breathe. Lights moved in impossible ways. Patterns formed in everything around them. They withdrew from one another and from staff, as though the world had become too loud, too chaotic to endure. Sleep became meaningless, food irrelevant. Even minor stimuli could provoke panic or aggression.

Decades into the experiment, all subjects were dying slowly, their bodies failing while their minds unraveled. They scribbled frantically in notebooks, trying to capture what their senses perceived: impossible geometries, entities no one else could see, sequences that seemed meaningful only to them.

The last surviving subject, NΦ‑17, bore the full weight of the experiment. Height stretched beyond human limits, limbs elongated unnaturally. Hair, teeth, and facial structure became alien. Eyes reflected light differently, seeing patterns no human could comprehend. They realized that no one could understand what they saw, and their body was failing in ways no one could prevent.

Finally, NΦ‑17 wrote a note in a calm, deliberate hand before ending their own life:

“You can’t make an angel in hell.”
Heart rate and respiration were normal until their final act. Tissue continued shifting even after death. Security footage from the last hours was missing. All other subjects had died gradually, following the same unstoppable decline.

A final lab report, recovered alongside the files, ends with a single, chilling line from the supervising scientist:

“They are deteriorating, yes… but this is progress.”
