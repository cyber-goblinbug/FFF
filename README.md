# The Nephilim Experiment
The facility had been abandoned for years. When explorers found it, the lights were dead, the halls silent. Among the dust and decay, a single server remained, powered by a backup generator no one could explain. On it were files labeled only “Continuation.”

The project had begun decades earlier, a genetic study with the stated goal of enhancing human adaptability. Internally, it was called something else: Reintegration Candidates.

The first subjects were children. Small, curious, unremarkable. They were chosen for rare traits: unusual bone growth, fast muscle recovery, reflexes that outpaced any adult, subtle cognitive anomalies. Over the years, the traits began to manifest—but slowly, almost imperceptibly, the children began to die.
